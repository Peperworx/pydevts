# Protocols

There are two different types of protocols used by PYDEVTS: Transport and Routing.

Transport protocols are used when sending completely raw data between two nodes with known addresses and direct connections. For example: TCP, UDP, QUIC.

Routing protocols are used by router implementations to store and send information to another node based on node id, as opposed to hostname and port. The data generated by these protocols is sent over a transport protocol to another node as seen fit by the routing mechanism.

## Transport protocols

Each transport protocol is implemented on top of the base class PYDEVTSTransport.

These must implement several methods:
- connect(host: str, port: int) -> self
    This method connects to server `host`:`port`
- serve(callback: function, host: str[, port: int = 0])
    This method serves on the specified host and port. When a connection is received, {callback} is called with a connection object.

The second part of a transport protocol is implemented in a subclass of PYDEVTSConnection.

This has several methods:
- send(data: bytes)
    This method sends all of the data provided over the connection.
- recv(size: int) -> bytes
    This method receives {size} data.
- close()
    This method closes the connection
